## Deck and card interpretation

No card appeared in every deck across the complete 100,000-game study. The highest overall deck inclusion was 78.18% for Spiced Ranch Water; the highest random-legal inclusion was 56.45%.
3 cards appeared in every deck produced by the single deterministic heuristic recipe: Spiced Saison, Spiced Ranch Water, City Spritz. This is retained as a **deck-diversity warning**, not treated as proof of mandatory inclusion across the metagame, because Prompt 10 implements one heuristic recipe rather than exhaustive optimal deck search or human deck telemetry.
0 cards were never selected and 3 were flagged underused; that is not a large unplayable group, but the named cards remain playtest watch items.

## Customer interpretation

The strongest customer-to-bartender concentration was 25.48%: Dance Floor DJ with Mara. No customer produced a 30% or greater concentration, so customer preference families remain meaningful without controlling outcomes.

## What remained unchanged

- All drink traits
- All other drink prices
- Customer preferences
- Bartender specialties and passives
- Appeal values
- Tip formula
- Switch-token rules
- Deck rules
- Victory target

## Handoff

Prompt 13 has converged on the locked simulation targets. Human playtesting remains the authority for feel and metagame diversity. Prompt 14 can now redesign the interface without carrying a known numeric bartender imbalance.
